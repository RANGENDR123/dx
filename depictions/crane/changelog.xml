		<version>1.2.4</version>
		<change>Fix a race condition inside the apsd hook where sometimes notification registrations would be made for the wrong app, causing incoming notifications to display the wrong app icon and name (If this issue affects you: Manually unregister all affected containers in container settings and start them again), Add an option to disable the new notifications feature globally (in root page) and per app (in app page if root setting is enabled), Fix a problem where the notifications of a container would not get removed if the app sets the badge count to 0, Improve notification registrations on iOS 11 and 12, Better handle cases where CraneSupport.dylib is not loaded into pkd or apsd, Don't redirect incoming notification to their Crane containers if CraneSB.dylib is not loaded into SpringBoard, Add Choicy Tweak Troubleshooting notice to the alert that appears when CraneSupport.dylib is not loaded into a daemon (only shown if Choicy is actually installed)</change>
